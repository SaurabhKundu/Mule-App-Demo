RAML for Simple Money-Transfer-API

RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) makes it easy to manage the whole API lifecycle from design to sharing. 
It's concise - you only write what you need to define - and reusable. 
It is machine readable API design that is actually human friendly.

You can create a RAML for your API and the same can be used by MuleSoft's Anypoint platform to generate the structure of the API.
